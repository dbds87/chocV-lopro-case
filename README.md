# chocV-lopro-case
I designed this This 3D printed case for the [chocV keyboard](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qaz](https://github.com/brickbots/chocV) as I didn't want to carry a bare PCB in my backpack. Tried to keep it as lowpro as possible by using [Peel-a-way sockets](https://ringerkeys.com/products/peel-a-way-sockets?srsltid=AfmBOoqq7pW5NGu-P4Lz0iNo3D_aoGtuXLu2mxBiXnGurEGPGoyi0mkQ) to socket the MCU.

You'll probably have to experiment with 4/5mm standoffs to see which one works best for you to mount the PCB to the case, and the MCU cover to the PCB.
